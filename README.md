# BookPi

Turn an old book into a covert server with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a battery for approximately $50 (USD).
In it's most basic form, it is just a Raspberry Pi Zero, a 6600 mAh LiIon battery, and a USB LiIon charger.
However, it can be extended to include whatever bells and whistles you want, like a display or a external HDD/SSD.

All the software is open source and can be found in this repo.
It is written in Python, for the display, and Rust, for the server.

## Parts List

As stated above, there are infinitely many configurations you could build.
